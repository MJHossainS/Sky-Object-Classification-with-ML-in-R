# Sky-Object-Classification-with-ML-in-R

This study aims to classify sky objects such as stars, galaxies and quasars using their spectral properties. The dataset provided contains 80,000 samples, each with their spectral characteristics and an assigned object type. The study will involve an in-depth exploratory data analysis, including identifying missing values and outliers, feature selection and feature engineering. The study will also investigate any relationships that may exist between the features. Through the evaluation of multiple classification algorithms, we aim to determine the best approach for accurate object classification. The research questions that the study aims to answer are:

 -Are there any missing values or outliers in the dataset?
 -Are there any relationship exists between the features?
 -Which classification algorithms performance in the class selection has a better accuracy?
 
This study delves into the process of preparing data, selecting features, designing new features and utilizing predictive modeling techniques to develop a robust model for sky object classification based on spectral properties.
